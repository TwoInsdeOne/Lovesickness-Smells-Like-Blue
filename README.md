# Lovesickness-Smells-Like-Blue
It's a game. Maybe metroidvania, puzzle, hardcore.
It's on very early stage of development. It will take a lot of time to conclude, so.. if you like, please be patient.
In order to run, you need to have [löve2d](https://love2d.org/ "LÖVE") installed.

## For windows
Just download the .exe or .zip

## For linux
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install love
```

## For Mac
I have never had a Mac :(

**after that, just open the .love file**

## How to play
Use W A S D for moving and G to use the yellow item.

### for now
don't use the mouse, it's just a cheating that helps me to design the map.
